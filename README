Completed this for my directed study.

The web app is quite simple. Using the JLDAP open Ldap
library, a user enters in a myID and password and the
LDAP Directory for uga authenticates on the password and
returns the user assuming the authentication is successful.

The heavy lifting is inside the SSLConnection class.

The User info returned can easily be customized.

The SSL certificates are available here:

And, you must be VPN'd into the UGA network for this application to 
be able to communicate with UGA's LDAP server.
